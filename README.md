# Anomaly Detection in Data Streams

## Project Overview
This project implements an anomaly detection system for continuous data streams using Python. The system simulates a data stream with seasonal patterns and noise, detects anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm, and visualizes the results.

## Objectives
- Simulate a continuous data stream with regular patterns and random noise.
- Implement an anomaly detection mechanism that identifies unusual data points.
- Provide real-time visualization of the data stream and detected anomalies.

## Features
- **Data Stream Simulation**: Generates a synthetic data stream with seasonal trends and noise.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the data.
- **Visualization**: Displays the data stream along with highlighted anomalies for easy analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
